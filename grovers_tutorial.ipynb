    "\n",
    "All coherent quantum systems interact with their environment, and are well known to decohere through Markovian dissipation processes that are modeled with a Limbladian operator. In this memoryless process, information flows irreversibly from the system to the environment. However, some physical systems exhibit a correlation time between the qubit and the environment, such as when the noise spectrum of the surrounding environment is narrow, as opposed to a broad, white noise spectrum, or when the system couples to transient radiation fields. In this case, the system can experience a resurgence in coherence from information backflow from the environment (also commonly referred to as the bath) to the system after finite times. <br>\n",
    "The stochastic wavefunction method is often used to model the time-evolution of open quantum systems, while the quantum circuit model is often used to model the transformation of the density matrices under discrete quantum transforamtions. For our final project, we use the quantum circuit model to simulate persistent-bath non-Markovian interactions between <i> system qubits </i> on which quantum algorithms were being performed and <i> environment qubits </i>. This configuration has many analogues to physical systems; the one that is focused on here is an ensemble of point defects whose electromagnetic field, originating from the binary orientation of the spins, each Stark shifts the frequency of each system flux-qubit via a ZZ-interaction, resulting in phase accumulation. The bath point defenct qubits occur unintentionally in the material of the superconducting circuit or the Josephson junctions that compose the system flux qubit, or the substrate on which the latter rests. The bath qubits exchange population between themselves and are governed by a XX+YY Hamiltonian, meaning the system-bath and bath-bath dynamics don't commute. \n"

    "We model the non-Markovian persistent bath as a coherent ensemble of qubits that do not decay, and are a closed system themselves when viewed from outside of the environment. This means that quantum coherent information is transfered from the system to the bath via the ZZ interaction and distributed between the bath qubits via the XX+YY interaction. The noise that the system experiences at a later time will contain quantum coherent information of it's state at an earlier time, thus meeting the non-Markovian condition for a persistent-bath. The Markovian bath, on the other hand, loses information via dissipation to other bath elements such that the system information thermalizes to such a high number of elements that the information content in any of the point defect states is negligible."
